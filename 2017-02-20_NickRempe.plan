Subject: First .PLAN file
Author: Nick Rempe

This is my first .PLAN file on this machine. I am going to try and do my best to keep a log of what is going on at work in the .PLAN files for future reference. I was inspired by the .PLAN files that John Carmack and John Romero wrote in the book Masters of Doom. It took the intial steps of reading the more impactful ones on the internet and moved on to reading the rest afterward. I hope that they are keeping .PLAN files because I think the idea is very novel and interesting. I think blogs are too sanitized and are more of a marketing tool than anything else. It would be nice to have these files to get the actual pulse of the company. I will try to do my best in writing these files and stick some sort of company culture reflection in each one. Hopefully.
